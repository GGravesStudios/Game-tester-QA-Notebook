##Intro
This is intended to be a brief introduction to the quality assurance function. I love the QA/ Tester field because it’s an entry level technical position at most studios. I’m a life long gamer since the 90’s. I’ve wanted to make games and do technical work since childhood. If you were like me as a child, constantly tinkering, and you’re looking into gaming as a career then you should definitely be looking at QA tester positions.
